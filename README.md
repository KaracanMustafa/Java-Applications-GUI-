# Software Projects Repository

Welcome to the Software Projects Repository!

This repository includes various software applications developed during my studies at Ya≈üar University. Each project is built using **Java** with a **Graphical User Interface (GUI)** and integrates with a **MySQL database** for data storage.

## Project Highlights

- **Java GUI Applications**: Developed using Java Swing for the graphical interface.
- **MySQL Integration**: All projects interact with MySQL databases for storing and retrieving data.
- **Design Patterns**: The projects utilize design patterns such as **MVC**, **Observer**, **Strategy**, **Composite**, and **Decorator** to ensure clean and maintainable code.
