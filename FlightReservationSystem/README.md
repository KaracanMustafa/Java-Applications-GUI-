# FlightReservationGUI

## Overview
`FlightReservationGUI` is a graphical user interface (GUI)-based application designed to simulate a flight reservation system. This project provides users with an intuitive interface to search for flights, book tickets, and manage reservations. Built with simplicity and usability in mind, it serves as a practical demonstration of GUI development and basic reservation system logic.

## Features
- **Flight Search**: Search for available flights based on origin, destination, and travel date.
- **Ticket Booking**: Reserve seats on selected flights with user input validation.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: A clean and interactive GUI for seamless navigation.
- **Reservation Management**: View and manage booked flights (if implemented).

## Technologies Used
- **Programming Language**: Java (inferred from common GUI projects; adjust if incorrect, e.g., Python with Tkinter, C# with Windows Forms, etc.).
- **GUI Framework**: Likely Swing or JavaFX (common for Java-based GUIs; specify exact framework if known).
- **Dependencies**: Standard libraries for GUI development and data handling (update with specific libraries if applicable).

## Installation
1. **Clone the Repository**: git clone https://github.com/KaracanMustafa/Java-Applications-GUI-/tree/main/FlightReservationSystem
